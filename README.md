# 7-Steps-To-Conduct-A-Penetration-Test-On-A-Web-Application
## What is a Web Application?

A web application is a special program that runs on a remote server, allowing users to interact with it via their browser without the need for downloading and installing it on their computers.

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing, or "pen testing," is an ethical and controlled process of testing technology products to identify and address exploitable security vulnerabilities. Pen testing involves simulating cyberattacks to evaluate the web application security, helping to protect sensitive assets and data from potential threats.

## Why should a web application be secured?

A web application stores sensitive information like user credentials, payment details, search histories, and business-critical data. Protecting this data is essential to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks. Performing a penetration test helps safeguard web application assets by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities.

## 7 Steps to Conduct Penetration Test on a Web Application

    Step 1: Pre-Engagement

The first stage involves formal discussions between client and the penetration tester to define the scope and objectives of the test. A key document called the Rules of Engagement (ROE) is created to ensure the engagement is ethical, legal, and agreed upon by both parties. The ROE should cover:

•	***Permission***: Explicit written consent from client, authorizing the penetration tester to conduct tests on the web application.

•	***Scope***: Clearly define whether the test will target the entire web application, specific features, or any network components.

•	***Rules***: Outline the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) the tester can use during the test, ensuring no harm comes to the live system.

    Step 2: Information Gathering (Reconnaissance/ Foot printing)

This stage involves collecting as much information as possible about the web application to identify potential vulnerabilities.

•	***Passive Reconnaissance***: Gathering publicly available information using tools like WHOIS, OSINT Framework, Wappalyzer, and Shodan. This phase involves identifying domain details, technology stacks, and IP ranges without directly interacting with the target.

•	***Active Reconnaissance***: Involves more direct interaction with application servers through techniques like port scanning (using Nmap or Netcat), traceroute, and DNS lookups. This helps identify live hosts, open ports, and active services.

    Step 3: Scanning (Vulnerability Assessment)

Once information has been gathered, the next step is to assess the web application for vulnerabilities.

•	***Vulnerability Scanning***: Use automated tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to scan for general vulnerabilities in the server or the application.

•	***Web Application Scanning***: Focus on specific web-based vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for common issues like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

    Step 4: Gaining Access (Exploitation)

In this stage, identified vulnerabilities are exploited to assess their impact. Some of the common exploitation techniques include:

•	***SQL Injection***: Manipulating SQL queries to bypass authentication or access sensitive data.

•	***Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)***: Injecting malicious scripts to steal session data or impersonate users.

•	***Denial of Service (DoS)***: Sending excessive traffic to overwhelm the web application’s server, rendering it inaccessible to users.

•	***Session Hijacking***: Exploiting weaknesses in session management to impersonate users and take over their accounts.

    Step 5: Maintaining Access (Post-Exploitation)

If access has been gained, the next step is to see if access can be maintained and if it allows escalation to higher privileges.

•	***Privilege Escalation***: Attempt to gain higher levels of access, such as administrative privileges, either through horizontal escalation (moving to another user with the same permissions) or vertical escalation (gaining more powerful permissions).

•	***Data Exfiltration***: Test how the web application responds to attempts to extract sensitive data without authorization. This is done to measure how effective the data protection mechanisms are.

    Step 6: Covering Tracks

Once the testing is done, it is crucial to ensure that all traces of the penetration test are removed to avoid any accidental disruption of the system. Writing down every action taken during the test will also help track potential vulnerabilities and aid in remediation efforts.

    Step 7: Reporting, Remediation, and Retesting

•	***Document Findings***: A comprehensive report is created, detailing the vulnerabilities found, the techniques used to exploit them, and their potential impact on the web application security.

•	***Remediation***: Provide actionable recommendations to client to mitigate identified risks. This should include prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and suggesting strategies based on the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities.

•	***Retesting***: Once client has implemented the recommended fixes, retesting is necessary to verify that the vulnerabilities have been successfully patched and no new issues have arisen.
